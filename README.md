Working with last.fm api json files to querry top artists,top songs,similar artist etc
I often play around with music charts and it helps me,if I have the DataFrame of such files.
There are four codes in the repisotory; each one with codes like etracting top songs by an artist,top bands etc.


Cheers!!
